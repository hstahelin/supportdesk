SupportDesk

## Overview

SupportDesk is a platform designed to streamline and enhance the efficiency of customer support teams. It provides tools to manage the entire lifecycle of support tickets, from creation and prioritization to assignment, resolution, and closure. By addressing the common challenges faced by support teams, SupportDesk aims to promote a more responsive, organized, and effective approach to customer support.

### Problem
